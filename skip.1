.TH SKIP 1
.SH NAME
\fBskip\fR \- skip text between two strings

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBskip\fR BEGIN END

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBskip\fR is a filter that skips the parts of the input text between
BEGIN and END. It reads standard input and writes the standard output
and does not regard newlines. When finding the end of a file, it
stops, even if the current position is after a BEGIN.
.P
skip does not buffer it's input, it is comparable to tr(1).

.SH EXAMPLE
\fBskip '<script' '</script'\fR prints the contents of a web-page
without the javascript.

.SH STATUS
0 on success and 1 when it prints the help message.

.SH BUGS
While waiting for END, skip needs a newline before the end of a file.
This should be fixed immediately.
